# RContext

RContext stands for Remote, Reactive, Real-time, and Reliable context management. It's a JavaScript library designed to manage relationships between entities, handle CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete), and synchronize state seamlessly with a remote server. It bundles changes into efficient requests, interprets server responses to keep the frontend state in sync, and emits real-time state updates for any modifications in the context. Perfect for building reactive, data-driven applications with minimal boilerplate.
